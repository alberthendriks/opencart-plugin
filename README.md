Bitcoin payment module using the BitMyMoney.nl service.

Installation
------------
Copy these files into your OpenCart directory.

Configuration
-------------
1. Create an API key at bitpay.com under the "My Account" section.
2. In the opencart administration under Extensions->Payments, click the "Install"
   link on the Bitpay row.
3. Also under Extensions->Payments, click the "Edit" link on the Bitpay row.
4. Set the API key to the key you created in step 1.  
5. Set the confirmed status to the order status that you would like to to use
   when a bitcoin payment is confirmed (according to your speed preference).  A
   status of "pending" is typically used.
6. Set the invalid status to the order status that you would like to use when a
    bitcoin payment has been determine to be invalid.  A status of "reversed" is
    typically used.  If you've chosen the low speed setting, an invoice will never
    become invalid.  For the medium and high speed settings, the invalid status is
    possible, but extremely rare.
7. Select a transaction speed.  The high speed will send a confirmation as soon
    as a transaction is received in the bitcoin network (usually a few seconds).  A
    medium speed setting will typically take 10 minutes.  The low speed setting
    usually takes around 1 hour.  See the bit-pay.com merchant documentation for a 
    full description of the transaction speed settings.
8. Set the status to enabled (this activates the bitpay payment extension and 
    enabled shoppers to select the bitcoin payment method).
9. Select a sort order.  The sort order determines the ordering of payment options
    presented to the shopper.

Usage
-----
When a shopping chooses the Bitcoin payment method, they will be presented with an
order summary as the next step (prices are shown in whatever currency they've selected
for shopping).  They will be presented with a button called "Pay with Bitcoin."  This
button takes the shopper to a bit-pay.com invoice where the user is presented with
bitcoin payment instructions.  Once payment is received, a link is presented to the 
shopper that will take them back to the order summary.

You can add BTC as a currency to your opencart installation.  This will allow shoppers
to view prices in BTC and when they checkout, the final price will be transmitted to
bit-pay.com in BTC.  The exact BTC amount transmitted is what will be requested of the 
shopper.  If the final price is expressed in another currency, then bit-pay.com will
convert that rate to a BTC total based on current exchanges rates (if bit-pay.com
supports that currency).  

Note: This extension does not provide a means of automatically pulling a current
BTC exchange rate for presenting BTC prices to shoppers.
